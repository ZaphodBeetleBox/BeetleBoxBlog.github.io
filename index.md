Welcome to the (Zaphod) BeetleBox Blog!

My name is Owen, this is my personal space for spewing data into the internet. 

My purpose is to create a new guide to the universe. Sometimes I think about philosophy, and it all swirls around meaninglessly unless I try to write it down. The goal here is to understand more of what I believe by attempting to explicate it. 

A quick disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing. I know very little programming and very little philosophy. If something is broken (technically or philosophically) please email me. Please also email if you have ideas you want to share, etc. This is an on-going project and mistakes will be made, but if anyone ever reads this, I would love to know, and am super curious about what you think of it!

Please read my first post for a more in-depth disclaimer and introduction to whats happening here.
